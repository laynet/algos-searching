1. What is a real-life scenario that uses linear search?
    any time you are looking through something one by one, like when I'm looking for a book on my shelf which isn't in sorted order.

2. What is a real-life scenario that uses binary search?
    looking through a list of contacts in my phone. I'll scroll to the letter I need then search through the names in that letter sorted alphabetically.

3. Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find the value G using linear search?
    7
4. Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find the value G using binary search?
    3
5. Given an unsorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.
    i would choose linear because binary searches need a sorted collection

6. Given a sorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning
    i would choose binary because it would be faster and cost less

PROGRAMMING ASSIGNMENT

1. You and a friend have set a wager to see who can find the word "Albatross" in the dictionary the fastest. Write a program to allow you to win the bet.
    let arr = ["Abalone","Acid","Adendum","Affix", "Ajax","Albatross","Avatar","Bowling","Cheese", "Dexterity"]

function binarySearch(array, target){
  let startIndex = 0;
  let endIndex = array.length - 1;
  while(startIndex <= endIndex) {
    let middleIndex = Math.floor((startIndex + endIndex) / 2);
    if(target === array[middleIndex]) {
      return console.log("Target was found at index " + middleIndex);
    }
    if(target > array[middleIndex]) {
      console.log("Searching the right side of Array")
      startIndex = middleIndex + 1;
    }
    if(target < array[middleIndex]) {
      console.log("Searching the left side of array")
      endIndex = middleIndex - 1;
    }
    else {
      console.log("Not Found this loop iteration. Looping another iteration.")
    }
  }
  
  console.log("Target value not found in array");
}

console.log(binarySearch(arr, "Albatross"))

2. You work at a pet store, and a child has asked you to net the only white-spotted goldfish from the fish tank. Write a program that will help you net the right fish.

let arr = ["shark", "guppy", "stingray", "white-spotted goldfish", "gold fish", "blue fish"]

function linearSearch(array, target){
  for(let i = 0; i < array.length; i++){
    if(array[i] === target) {
      return "you've netted the white-spotted goldfish"
    }
  }
  return "sorry, no fish to be found";
}

console.log(linearSearch(arr, "white-spotted goldfish"))
